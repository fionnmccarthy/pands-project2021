## 1. Overview ##

This is the repository for the Programming and Scripting 2021 project. The aim of this project is to investigate how python can be utilized in order to carry out data analysis on the Fisher's Iris data set **[[1](https://datahub.io/machine-learning/iris)]**.

## Background Research of Fisher's Data Set ##
The Fisher's Iris dataset was renowned for it's use in statistal study carried out by a famous British statistician Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (R.A. Fisher) called "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" **[[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher)]**. Although the Iris flower data set is refereed to as Fisher's Iris data set it was in fact data collated by a famous botanist Dr. Edgar Anderson **[[6](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2394164?origin=crossref&seq=1)]**.

In the Iris dataset there was a total of 150 records on a species of iris flower. The flowers were broken down into three different species within the dataset. Each record corresponds to measures that were taken on each flower. In each case the sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width (all in centimetres) were measure on 5o different flowers of each species **[[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)]**. Figure 1.1 above shows the three different species of iris flowers that the data was collated on:
1. Iris setosa.
2. Iris versicolor.
3. Iris virginica.
